In this article, we will show you how to download and use Cardtool Exe, as well as some of its features and limitations.
  
## How to Download Cardtool Exe
 
Cardtool Exe is a freeware that can be downloaded from various websites, such as Softpedia[^1^] or Software Informer[^2^]. The file size is very small, around 37 KB, and it does not require installation. You can simply unzip the file and run the executable.
 
However, before you download Cardtool Exe, make sure you have a compatible operating system. The software works on Windows All versions, but it has not been updated since 2008, so it may not run smoothly on newer systems. Also, be careful not to download any malicious or fake versions of Cardtool Exe from untrusted sources.
  
## How to Use Cardtool Exe
 
Cardtool Exe has a simple and intuitive interface that consists of a single window with two tabs: Check and Generate. Here is how to use each tab:
  
### Check Tab
 
The Check tab allows you to verify if a credit card number is valid or not. To do this, you just need to enter the card number in the box and click on Check. A message will appear on the bottom part of the window, telling you if the card is valid or not.
 
The software uses a mathematical algorithm called Luhn algorithm to check the validity of the card number. This algorithm checks if the number follows a certain pattern and if the checksum digit matches. However, this does not mean that the card is active or has funds. It only means that the number is formatted correctly.
  
### Generate Tab
 
The Generate tab allows you to create random credit card numbers that are valid according to the Luhn algorithm. To do this, you need to specify some parameters, such as:
 
- The number of digits: You can choose between 13, 14, 15, or 16 digits.
- The card service: You can choose between Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, Diners Club, or JCB.
- The prefix: You can enter a specific prefix for the card number, such as 4 for Visa or 5 for Mastercard.

After you set these parameters, click on Generate and a random card number will appear in the box. You can also copy and paste it to another application.
