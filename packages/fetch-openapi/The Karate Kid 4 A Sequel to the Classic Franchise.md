If you are a fan of The Karate Kid franchise and want to watch or rewatch the previous seasons of Cobra Kai, you can stream them on Netflix. However, if you prefer to download them for offline viewing, you may be tempted to look for torrent sites that offer The Karate Kid 4 720p download. However, this is not a legal or safe option, as torrenting may expose you to malware, viruses, hackers, and legal issues.
 
Instead of risking your device and your privacy by using torrent sites, you should consider using a VPN service that can help you access Netflix from anywhere in the world. A VPN, or virtual private network, is a tool that encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a server in another country. This way, you can bypass geo-restrictions and access Netflix content that may not be available in your region.
 
A VPN can also protect you from online threats such as cyberattacks, identity theft, and surveillance. By hiding your IP address and location, a VPN can prevent anyone from tracking your online activities or stealing your personal information. A VPN can also help you avoid bandwidth throttling, which is when your internet service provider slows down your connection when you stream or download large files.
 
There are many VPN services available on the market, but not all of them are reliable or trustworthy. Some VPNs may keep logs of your data, sell your information to third parties, or leak your IP address. Therefore, you should choose a VPN that has a strict no-logs policy, a large network of servers, fast speeds, strong encryption, and a kill switch feature.
 
One of the best VPNs for streaming Netflix is ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN has over 3,000 servers in 94 countries, including the US, UK, Canada, Japan, and Australia. ExpressVPN can unblock Netflix and other popular streaming platforms such as Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, and BBC iPlayer. ExpressVPN also offers blazing-fast speeds, military-grade encryption, a kill switch feature, and a 30-day money-back guarantee.
