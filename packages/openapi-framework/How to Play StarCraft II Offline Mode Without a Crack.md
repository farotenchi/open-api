# How to Play StarCraft II Offline Mode Without a Crack
 
StarCraft II is a popular real-time strategy game that requires an internet connection to play online. However, some players may want to play the game offline for various reasons, such as having a slow or unreliable internet connection, or wanting to avoid online cheaters and hackers. To do so, they may use a crack, which is a software tool that modifies the game files to bypass the online authentication and enable offline mode. However, using a crack is illegal and risky, as it may damage the game files, expose the user to malware, or result in a ban from the game servers.
